# Phase 2: Shared Infrastructure Complete âœ…

## Summary
Built Angular-specific shared infrastructure including signal-based state management, reusable components, directives, and routing guards.

## What Was Accomplished

### Services
- **GameStateService** - Signal-based reactive state management
- **CommandExecutorService** - Command pattern for all game actions

### Components
- **MenuComponent** - Reusable menu with keyboard navigation (Pattern 1)

### Directives
- **KeystrokeInputDirective** - "Press any key" input handling (Pattern 3)

### Guards
- **partyExistsGuard** - Ensures party exists before maze/combat
- **partyNotInMazeGuard** - Prevents town access while in maze

### Styles
- Retro SCSS theme with CRT scanline effects
- Variables for colors, typography, spacing
- Utility classes for layout
- Mobile responsiveness (@media queries)

## Test Results
- Test Suites: 12 passing
- Tests: 63 passing
- Coverage: High coverage on all infrastructure code

## Bundle Size
- Main bundle: 182 KB
- Polyfills: 34 KB
- **Total: 216 KB** (well under 250-300KB target)

## Additional Improvements Made

### Type System
- Added `MAZE` and `COMBAT` to `SceneType` enum
- Improved `Party` type definition:
  - Added `level` to position (track dungeon level 1-10)
  - Replaced `inMaze` with `light` (matches Wizardry mechanics)
  - Kept `facing` inside position for spatial cohesion

### Service Migrations
- Converted `SaveService` from plain object export to Angular `@Injectable` class
- Added support for multiple save slots
- Updated `loadGame()` to return null instead of throwing when no save exists

### Code Quality
- All services use Angular dependency injection
- All tests use TestBed for proper Angular testing
- Modern SCSS with `@use` instead of deprecated `@import`
- TypeScript strict mode compliance throughout

## Git Commits Created
1. `refactor: improve Party type definition for better game design`
2. `refactor: convert SaveService to Angular injectable service`
3. `feat: create GameStateService with signal-based state`
4. `feat: create CommandExecutorService for command pattern`
5. `feat: create route guards for party validation`
6. `fix: add MAZE and COMBAT to SceneType enum and use enum throughout`
7. `feat: create retro SCSS theme with CRT effects`
8. `feat: create reusable MenuComponent with keyboard navigation`
9. `feat: create KeystrokeInputDirective for any-key input`
10. `fix: update SCSS imports to use modern @use syntax`

## Next Steps
Phase 3 will implement the first scenes:
- Title Screen (using KeystrokeInputDirective)
- Castle Menu (using MenuComponent)
- Edge of Town (party formation management)

See: `docs/plans/2025-11-01-angular-migration-phase-3.md` (to be created)

## Architecture Notes

**Signal-Based State**: GameStateService uses Angular signals for reactive state management, providing automatic change detection without Zone.js overhead.

**Command Pattern**: All game actions will go through CommandExecutorService, enabling future undo/redo, action queuing for combat, and replay systems.

**Standalone Components**: All components and directives use standalone: true, avoiding NgModule boilerplate.

**Functional Guards**: Route guards use modern `CanActivateFn` functional syntax instead of class-based guards.

**Pure Services**: Business logic services remain pure functions, now consumed by Angular services for dependency injection.

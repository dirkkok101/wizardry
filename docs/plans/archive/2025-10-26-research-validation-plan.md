> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Systematically validate all research documentation files against the 60 online sources, identify gaps, extract missing data, and ensure 100% accuracy across all research documents.

**Architecture:** Source-by-source validation approach where each high-priority unused source is fetched, analyzed, and cross-referenced against existing research files. Updates are made incrementally with validation tracking.

**Tech Stack:** WebFetch for source retrieval, markdown documentation, git for version control

---

## Validation Strategy

**Current State:**
- 11 research files exist
- 15/60 sources used (25%)
- 45/60 sources unused (75%)
- Core systems documented but gaps exist

**Validation Approach:**
- High-priority sources first (12 sources)
- Medium-priority sources second (18 sources)
- Low-priority sources for completeness (12 sources)
- Failed sources last (3 sources - retry with alternatives)

**Success Criteria:**
- All factual claims backed by 2+ sources
- All unused high/medium-priority sources reviewed
- Gaps identified and documented
- Validation matrix updated to 100%

---

3. Accept gap if truly inaccessible

**Step 2: Retry Wizardry Wiki Items List (#19)**

Original URL: https://wizardry.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_items_in_Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord

Action:
- Try URL variations
- Check if URL changed
- Use wiki search if direct link fails

**Step 3: Address TK421 Maps (image-based)**

Note: Coordinates require manual extraction or image parsing

Options:
1. Manual coordinate extraction (time-intensive)
2. Use Strategy Wiki coordinates instead
3. Document as "verified via alternative source"

**Step 4: Document retry results**

```markdown
## Failed Source Resolution

### Manual PDF:
- Status: [✅ found alternative / ⚠️ remains inaccessible]
- Alternative: [source used instead]

### Wizardry Wiki Items (#19):
- Status: [✅ accessed / ⚠️ permanently 404]
- Alternative: [already covered by #17, #18]

### TK421 Maps (#24):
- Status: [⚠️ deferred - coordinates via Strategy Wiki]
- Note: Image-based, manual extraction not prioritized
```

**Step 5: Update source-materials.md status**

Mark retry attempts:
```markdown
### Original Manual PDF
- **Status**: ⚠️ **RETRY ATTEMPTED** - [result]

### 19. Wizardry Wiki - Items List
- **Status**: ⚠️ **RETRY ATTEMPTED** - [result]
```

**Step 6: Commit retry results**

```bash
git add docs/research/*.md docs/research/validation-log.md docs/research/source-materials.md
git commit -m "docs(research): retry failed sources, document resolution"

## Task 16: Final Validation Summary

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/research/validation-summary-2025-10-26.md`
- Update: `docs/research/validation-log.md`
- Update: `docs/research/source-materials.md`

**Step 1: Generate validation statistics**

Calculate:
```markdown
# Research Validation Summary (2025-10-26)

## Source Coverage
- Total sources: 60
- Used before validation: 15 (25%)
- Used during validation: [X]
- Total validated: [15+X] ([%])
- Remaining: [60-15-X]

## Validation Results
- Discrepancies found: [count]
- Discrepancies resolved: [count]
- New data extracted: [count of new sections]
- Files updated: [count]

## Accuracy Metrics
- Pre-validation accuracy: 68%
- Post-validation accuracy: [%]
- Validation confidence: [high/medium/low per system]
```

**Step 2: List all discrepancies found**

Document every error/mismatch:
```markdown
## Discrepancies Corrected

1. **[System/File]:** [Description]
   - Source: [#X]
   - Original claim: [what we had]
   - Corrected to: [what source says]
   - Resolution: [action taken]

[Repeat for all discrepancies]
```

**Step 3: List all new data extracted**

```markdown
## New Information Added

1. **XP Tables:** Complete level 1-13 progression per class
   - Source: #37
   - File: [location]

2. **Trap Formulas:** Disarm success rate mechanics
   - Sources: #45, #46
   - File: [location]

[etc...]
```

**Step 4: Identify remaining gaps**

```markdown
## Known Gaps Remaining

### Blocked by Source Issues
- [ ] Original manual PDF data (LZW compression)
- [ ] Detailed map coordinates floors 2-9 (image extraction)

### Low-Priority Sources Not Yet Reviewed
- [ ] Historical context sources (#1, #30, #55)
- [ ] Video sources (#48, #49)
- [ ] Platform comparison sources (#2)

### Acceptable Gaps
- [List any gaps we're okay leaving unfilled]
```

**Step 5: Update source-materials.md with final counts**

Update header:
```markdown
**Total Sources**: 60 URLs
**Sources Used (Post-Validation)**: [X] sources ✅
**Remaining Sources**: [Y] sources ⬜
**Failed Sources**: [Z] sources ⚠️
```

**Step 6: Commit final validation summary**

```bash
git add docs/research/validation-summary-2025-10-26.md docs/research/validation-log.md docs/research/source-materials.md
git commit -m "docs(research): complete validation summary and final statistics"
```

## Task 17: Update Week 1 Research Summary

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/research/week1-research-summary.md`
- Update: Create header note about validation pass

**Step 1: Add validation addendum to week1 summary**

Prepend to file:
```markdown
---
**VALIDATION UPDATE (2025-10-26):**
This document represents Week 1 research findings. A comprehensive validation pass was performed on 2025-10-26 against all high/medium-priority sources. See `validation-summary-2025-10-26.md` for validation results.

**Post-Validation Status:**
- Sources reviewed: [X/60]
- Accuracy: [%]
- Gaps filled: [list major additions]
---

[Original Week 1 content follows...]
```

**Step 2: Note any corrections to Week 1 findings**

If Week 1 had errors:
```markdown
## Week 1 Corrections (Post-Validation)

1. **[Topic]:** Original finding was [X], corrected to [Y] per source #[Z]
[etc...]
```

**Step 3: Commit week1 summary update**

```bash
git add docs/research/week1-research-summary.md
git commit -m "docs(research): add validation addendum to week1 summary"
```

## Success Criteria Checklist

After completing all tasks, verify:

- [ ] All high-priority sources (#2, #8, #13, #15, #21, #31, #32, #35, #37, #41, #45, #52) reviewed
- [ ] All medium-priority sources attempted or evaluated
- [ ] Validation log documents every source reviewed
- [ ] All discrepancies between sources resolved
- [ ] New data extracted and integrated into research files
- [ ] Source-materials.md status markers updated
- [ ] Design-validation-matrix.md percentages recalculated
- [ ] Final validation summary created
- [ ] All changes committed with descriptive messages
- [ ] Remaining gaps documented with rationale

## Notes for Engineer

**WebFetch Tool:**
You have pre-approved access to specific domains:
- wizardry.fandom.com
- strategywiki.org
- datadrivengamer.blogspot.com
- www.zimlab.com
- www.tk421.net
- dungeoncrawl-classics.com

**Handling Discrepancies:**
When two sources disagree:
1. Prefer primary sources (strategy guides, code) over community (Reddit)
2. Prefer detailed mechanics sources over summaries
3. Prefer Apple II version over ports (NES, etc.)
4. Document the conflict in validation-log.md
5. Make judgment call and note reasoning

**Commit Frequency:**
Commit after each task (every 5-10 sources reviewed), not after every source.

**Time Estimates:**
- High-priority sources: ~15-20 minutes each
- Medium-priority sources: ~10 minutes each
- Low-priority sources: ~5 minutes each
- Total estimated time: 6-8 hours for complete validation

**Validation != Duplication:**
If a source confirms existing documentation without adding new data, mark it as "✅ Validated" but don't duplicate content. Only add new information.

## Execution Instructions

This plan is designed for bite-sized execution. Each task takes 20-40 minutes.

**Recommended execution order:**
1. Tasks 1-2 (setup + first validation) - get familiar
2. Tasks 3-6 (core systems) - highest value
3. Tasks 7-9 (supplementary mechanics) - fill gaps
4. Tasks 10-13 (maps + community) - completeness
5. Tasks 14-17 (reporting) - documentation

**Parallel execution possible:**
- Tasks 3-6 can be done in any order (different systems)
- Tasks 7-9 can be done in any order (independent mechanics)
- Task 13 (community sources) can be done early or late

**Checkpoints:**
After tasks 2, 6, 9, 13, and 17 - review validation-log.md and assess progress.

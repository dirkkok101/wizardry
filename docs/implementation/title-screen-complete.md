# Title Screen Implementation - Complete

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Tasks Completed**: 10/10
**Test Coverage**: 75 tests passing across 9 test files

## Summary

Successfully implemented a fully functional title screen for Wizardry Reforged using vanilla TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas. The implementation includes complete asset loading, scene management, input handling, save/load functionality, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Architecture Decision: React → Canvas Pivot

**Original Plan**: React-based UI with components
**Implemented**: Vanilla TypeScript + HTML5 Canvas game architecture

**Rationale**:
- Canvas provides pixel-perfect rendering control essential for retro game aesthetics
- Better performance for game rendering loops
- More appropriate for traditional game architecture patterns
- Simpler state management for game scenes
- Eliminated unnecessary React overhead for non-reactive UI

## Components Implemented

### Core Services (Pure Function Architecture)

1. **AssetLoadingService** (`src/services/AssetLoadingService.ts`)
   - Two-phase loading: critical path (title assets) + parallel (game assets)
   - Asset caching with Map-based storage
   - Event handlers for load complete/progress/error
   - Image loading with promise-based API
   - Test coverage: 8 tests

2. **SceneNavigationService** (`src/services/SceneNavigationService.ts`)
   - Scene transition system with fade effects
   - Navigation history tracking (max 100 entries)
   - Transition validation and blocking
   - Scene enter/exit event handlers
   - Test coverage: 8 tests

3. **InputService** (`src/services/InputService.ts`)
   - Keyboard event handling (case-insensitive by default)
   - Mouse click handling for DOM elements
   - Input enable/disable state management
   - waitForSingleKeystroke with optional key filtering
   - Returns unsubscribe functions for cleanup
   - Test coverage: 8 tests

4. **SaveService** (`src/services/SaveService.ts`)
   - localStorage save/load operations
   - Save validation and corruption handling
   - Version tracking (1.0.0)
   - Timestamp tracking
   - Test coverage: 8 tests

5. **GameInitializationService** (`src/services/GameInitializationService.ts`)
   - Creates new game with default state
   - Default values: `{ party: { inMaze: false }, gold: 0 }`
   - Test coverage: 1 test

### Commands (Business Logic)

1. **StartGameCommand** (`src/commands/StartGameCommand.ts`)
   - 6-step workflow: validate → check save → load/create → determine destination → transition → return
   - Integrates SaveService, GameInitializationService, SceneNavigationService
   - Handles corrupted saves gracefully (falls back to new game)
   - Destination logic: CAMP if `party.inMaze === true`, else CASTLE_MENU
   - Test coverage: 8 tests

### Scenes (Game Screens)

1. **TitleScreenScene** (`src/scenes/TitleScreenScene.ts`)
   - Three-state machine: LOADING → READY → TRANSITIONING
   - Canvas rendering: title bitmap, subtitle, button, copyright text
   - Asset loading integration
   - Input handling (S key and mouse click on button)
   - Proper event listener cleanup in destroy()
   - Hover effects on start button
   - Test coverage: 13 tests

2. **CastleMenuScene** (`src/scenes/CastleMenuScene.ts`)
   - Placeholder scene (to be implemented)
   - Shows "CASTLE MENU - Coming Soon"

3. **CampScene** (`src/scenes/CampScene.ts`)
   - Placeholder scene (to be implemented)
   - Shows "CAMP - Edge of the Maze - Coming Soon"

### Managers

1. **SceneManager** (`src/managers/SceneManager.ts`)
   - Manages complete scene lifecycle: exit → destroy → create → init → enter
   - Factory pattern to create scenes by SceneType
   - Thread-safe transition locking
   - Listens to SceneNavigationService for transitions
   - Game loop integration (update/render)
   - Test coverage: 18 tests

### Types

1. **SceneType** (`src/types/SceneType.ts`)
   - Enum defining all game scenes: TITLE_SCREEN, CASTLE_MENU, CAMP

2. **GameState** (`src/types/GameState.ts`)
   - Core game state types: Party, GameState, SaveData

3. **Scene** (`src/scenes/Scene.ts`)
   - Base interface for all scenes
   - Lifecycle methods: init, enter, update, render, exit, destroy

### Main Application

1. **main.ts** (`src/main.ts`)
   - Responsive canvas with 4:3 aspect ratio
   - Fixed internal resolution: 640×480
   - Pixel-perfect scaling to fit browser window
   - Game loop with requestAnimationFrame
   - Delta time calculation for frame-independent updates
   - SceneManager integration

## Test Coverage

**Total Tests**: 75 passing tests across 9 test files

### Unit Tests (72 tests)
- `AssetLoadingService.test.ts`: 8 tests
- `SceneNavigationService.test.ts`: 8 tests
- `InputService.test.ts`: 8 tests
- `SaveService.test.ts`: 8 tests
- `GameInitializationService.test.ts`: 1 test
- `StartGameCommand.test.ts`: 8 tests
- `TitleScreenScene.test.ts`: 13 tests
- `SceneManager.test.ts`: 18 tests

### Integration Tests (3 tests)
- `TitleScreenFlow.test.ts`: 3 end-to-end flow tests
  1. New game flow: title screen → castle menu
  2. Load game with party in maze: title screen → camp
  3. Corrupted save handling: title screen → new game → castle menu

## Key Features

### Responsive Canvas
- Maintains 4:3 aspect ratio
- Scales to fit available browser window
- Fixed internal resolution (640×480) for pixel-perfect rendering
- CSS centering and responsive sizing

### Asset Loading
- Critical path loading for title screen (shows immediately)
- Parallel loading for remaining game assets
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Asset caching to prevent redundant loads

### Scene Management
- Clean scene lifecycle with proper initialization and cleanup
- Memory leak prevention via destroy() methods
- Event listener cleanup
- State machine patterns for scene modes

### Save/Load System
- localStorage persistence
- Version tracking and validation
- Corruption detection and recovery
- Graceful fallback to new game

### Input Handling
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Input blocking during transitions
- Event listener cleanup
- Case-insensitive key handling

## Critical Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Event Listener Memory Leak
**Location**: TitleScreenScene.ts
**Problem**: Mouse event listeners added to canvas but never removed in destroy()
**Fix**: Stored handlers as class properties and removed them in destroy() method
**Impact**: Prevents memory leaks when transitioning between scenes

### Issue 2: Missing Scene Transition Mechanism
**Location**: Initial architecture
**Problem**: No way to switch scenes when StartGameCommand completes
**Fix**: Created SceneManager that listens to SceneNavigationService and performs full scene lifecycle transitions
**Impact**: Enabled working end-to-end flow from title screen to game

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Scene: Castle Menu
The Castle Menu scene is the main hub where players can:
- Visit the Training Grounds (create characters)
- Go to Gilgamesh's Tavern (add/remove party members)
- Visit Boltac's Trading Post (buy/sell equipment)
- Go to Temple of Cant (heal, resurrect)
- Visit the Adventurer's Inn (save game, inspect characters)
- Enter the Edge of Town (start dungeon)
- Access Utilities Menu

**Implementation Path**:
1. Create CastleMenuScene with menu rendering
2. Implement menu navigation (arrow keys + enter)
3. Create command for each menu option
4. Create scenes for each location
5. Add integration tests for menu flow

### Additional Features to Implement
1. **Camp Scene**: Party management while in dungeon
2. **Maze Scene**: 3D dungeon exploration
3. **Combat Scene**: Turn-based combat system
4. **Character Creation**: Race/class selection, stat rolling
5. **Equipment System**: Inventory management, equip/unequip
6. **Spell System**: Spell casting, spell book
7. **Sound System**: Background music, sound effects

### Technical Improvements
1. Add sprite loading for character/monster graphics
2. Implement audio loading in AssetLoadingService
3. Add animation system for transitions
4. Create reusable UI components (menu, dialog box, stat display)
5. Implement game state persistence beyond save/load
6. Add error boundaries and recovery mechanisms

## Design Decisions

- Thread-safe by default
- Composable

### Why Scene Pattern?

- Reusable across different input methods
- Clear separation from UI code

### Why Canvas Instead of React?
- Pixel-perfect rendering control
- Better performance for game loops
- Traditional game architecture patterns
- Simpler state management
- No virtual DOM overhead

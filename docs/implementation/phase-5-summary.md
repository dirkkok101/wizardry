# Phase 5: Town Service Business Logic - Completion Summary

**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Status**: Complete ✅
**Test Coverage**: 336 tests passing in 3.48 seconds

## Overview

Phase 5 implemented complete business logic for three town service components (Temple, Shop, Training Grounds) with full integration testing. All placeholder messages have been removed and the codebase is production-ready for these features.

## Completed Features

### 1. Temple Component
**Services Implemented:**
- **Cure Services**: Poison, Paralysis cure with tithe calculations
- **Resurrection**: Dead → OK with success rates based on Vitality
- **Restore Services**: Full HP/status restoration with level-based pricing
- **Character Status Transitions**: DEAD → ASHES → LOST handling
- **Party-based Gold System**: All transactions use party gold

**Technical Highlights:**
- Service type system with enum-based routing
- Tithe calculation formula: `(10 * level * serviceMultiplier) + basePrice`
- Resurrection success rate: `min(90, 50 + vitality * 2)`
- Character status validation and filtering
- 43 tests covering all service flows

### 2. Shop Component
**Services Implemented:**
- **Buy Flow**: Purchase items with gold/inventory/class validation
- **Sell Flow**: Sell items at 50% price with cursed item restrictions
- **Identify Flow**: Identify unknown items (100 gold flat fee)
- **Character Selection**: Per-character inventory management
- **Party-based Gold System**: All transactions use shared party gold

**Technical Highlights:**
- Class restriction validation (e.g., only Fighters can buy Long Swords)
- Inventory limit enforcement (8 items maximum per character)
- Cursed item detection (cannot sell cursed items)
- Item identification reveals true name and properties
- Sell confirmation dialog for safety
- 60+ tests covering all flows

### 3. Training Grounds Component
**Services Implemented:**
- **7-Step Character Creation Wizard**:
  1. Race selection (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Hobbit)
  2. Alignment selection (Good, Neutral, Evil)
  3. Stat rolling (3d6 per attribute with authentic formula)
  4. Bonus point allocation with real-time class eligibility
  5. Class selection (8 classes with stat requirements)
  6. Name/password input with validation
  7. Confirmation and roster addition

**Technical Highlights:**
- Authentic Wizardry bonus point formula: `max(0, (STR + INT + PIE + VIT + AGI) - 60)`
- Real-time class eligibility calculation as bonus points allocated
- Race stat modifiers applied correctly
- Character validation (name 1-15 chars, password 4-8 chars alphanumeric)
- Wizard state management with reset after character creation
- 43 tests covering full wizard flow

## New Services Created

1. **CharacterService** (29 tests)
   - `getEligibleClasses()`: Calculate which classes character qualifies for
   - `createCharacterFromStats()`: Create character from wizard data
   - `validateCharacterName()`: Name validation rules
   - `validatePassword()`: Password validation rules
   - Pure function service with no side effects

2. **TempleService** (14 tests)
   - `calculateTithe()`: Tithe calculation based on service type
   - Service type enum with multipliers

3. **ResurrectionService** (12 tests)
   - `calculateResurrectionSuccess()`: Success rate based on Vitality
   - Death state transitions

4. **ShopService** (8 tests)
   - `calculateSellPrice()`: 50% of purchase price (floored)
   - `calculateIdentifyPrice()`: Flat 100 gold fee
   - `canAfford()`: Purchase validation

5. **InventoryService** (existing, extended with 22 tests)
   - `addItem()`: Add item to character inventory
   - `removeItem()`: Remove item from inventory
   - `hasSpace()`: Check inventory capacity
   - `canEquip()`: Class restriction validation

## Integration Tests

**5 E2E Integration Tests Created:**

1. **Character Creation E2E** (2 tests)
   - Full wizard flow from race to confirmation
   - Multiple character creation in sequence
   - Wizard reset verification

2. **Shop Flows E2E** (3 tests)
   - Buy → Sell transaction flow
   - Gold balance tracking across multiple transactions
   - Inventory persistence across flow transitions

**Integration Test Highlights:**
- Tests span multiple components and services
- No mocks - real service calls with actual data
- State persistence verification across component lifecycle
- Real-world user workflows

## Test Coverage Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 336 passing
- **Test Execution Time**: 3.48 seconds (under 4s target ✅)
- **New Tests in Phase 5**: ~150 tests
  - CharacterService: 29 tests
  - TrainingGroundsComponent: 43 tests
  - ShopComponent: 60+ tests
  - TempleComponent: 43 tests
  - Integration tests: 5 tests
  - Supporting services: ~20 tests

## Architecture Highlights

### Signal-Based Reactivity
- All components use Angular signals for reactive state
- No manual change detection needed
- Automatic UI updates on state changes

### Immutable State Updates
- All state changes create new objects (spread operators)
- No mutations anywhere in codebase
- GameStateService.updateState() enforces immutability

### Party-First Design
- Gold managed at party level, not per-character
- All services deduct from party.gold
- Consistent with original Wizardry design

### Pure Function Services
- All business logic services are pure functions
- No side effects - easy to test and reason about
- No mocking needed in unit tests

### TDD Methodology
- All features developed test-first
- Tests written before implementation
- High confidence in code correctness

- **Inn Resting**: Not implemented (Phase 6)
- **Tavern Services**: Not implemented (Phase 6)
- **Dungeon Navigation**: Not implemented (Phase 7)

## Migration Notes

### From Original Wizardry
- Authentic stat rolling formula preserved
- Authentic bonus point calculation preserved
- Authentic class requirements preserved
- Authentic resurrection mechanics preserved
- All game balance identical to 1981 original

### Angular-Specific Improvements
- Signal-based reactivity (vs. manual change detection)
- TypeScript strict mode (vs. original assembly/Pascal)
- Jest testing framework (comprehensive test coverage)
- Component-based architecture (vs. monolithic design)

## Next Steps (Phase 6)

1. **Castle Menu Integration**
   - Roster viewing and management
   - Character inspection UI
   - Party formation controls

2. **Inn Services**
   - Room rental (rest and restore)
   - Stable management
   - Party member addition/removal

3. **Tavern Services**
   - Add characters to party
   - Remove characters from party
   - Dismiss characters to roster

4. **Save/Load System**
   - Save game to IndexedDB
   - Load saved games
   - Multiple save slots

## Lessons Learned

1. **TDD Works**: Writing tests first caught many edge cases early
2. **Pure Functions Win**: No mocks needed makes tests fast and reliable
3. **Signals are Great**: Automatic reactivity reduced boilerplate significantly
4. **Integration Tests Matter**: Caught issues unit tests missed
5. **Performance is Easy**: Pure functions + signals = fast tests naturally

## Conclusion

Phase 5 is complete with all objectives met:
- ✅ Temple services fully functional
- ✅ Shop services fully functional
- ✅ Character creation wizard fully functional
- ✅ All placeholders removed
- ✅ 336 tests passing
- ✅ <4 second test execution
- ✅ Documentation updated

# Data Model Diagram

**Visual representation of entity relationships.**

## Description

The data model uses immutable entities with clear ownership and relationships:

- **GameState**: Root entity containing all game data
- **Character Roster**: Map of all created characters (0-20)
- **Active Party**: Current adventuring party (1-6 characters)
- **Equipment & Inventory**: Character-owned items
- **Dungeon State**: Current level, position, exploration

All entities are immutable; updates create new instances.

## Core Entity Details

### GameState (Root Entity)

**Purpose**: Root of all game data; single source of truth

**Relationships**:
- Has one GameMode (TOWN, NAVIGATION, COMBAT, etc.)
- Contains one CharacterRoster (all characters)
- Has one active Party (current adventuring party)
- Contains one DungeonState (dungeon data)
- Logs many Events (action history)

**Immutability**: Every game action returns new GameState

### Character Roster

**Purpose**: Storage for all created characters

**Relationships**:
- Stores 0-20 characters in a Map (id â†’ Character)
- Characters can be in/out of active party
- Dead characters remain in roster (until deleted)

## Data Flow Patterns

### Immutable Updates

All updates create new objects:
```typescript
// Update character HP
const updatedChar = {
  ...character,
  stats: {
    ...character.stats,
    hp: newHP
  }
}

// Update state with new character
const newState = {
  ...state,
  roster: new Map(state.roster).set(character.id, updatedChar)
}
```

### Event Sourcing

All actions create events:
```typescript
const event = {
  type: 'MOVE_FORWARD',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  data: { from: oldPos, to: newPos }
}

const newState = {
  ...state,
  party: { ...state.party, position: newPos },
  eventLog: [...state.eventLog, event]
}
```

## Key Relationships

**1:1 Relationships**:
- GameState â†’ Party (one active party)
- Party â†’ Formation (one formation)
- Character â†’ Stats (one stat block)
- Character â†’ Equipment (one equipment set)

**1:N Relationships**:
- GameState â†’ Events (many logged events)
- CharacterRoster â†’ Character (0-20 characters)
- Party â†’ Character (1-6 active characters)
- Equipment â†’ Item (8 equipment slots)
- SpellBook â†’ Spell (many learned spells)

**N:N Relationships**:
- None (simplified design)

## Storage Strategy

**In-Memory**:
- GameState (current game state)
- Character Roster (all characters)
- Active Party (current party)

**IndexedDB** (Persistence):
- Saved games (serialized GameState)
- Event log (replay data)
- Character archive (deleted characters)

**JSON Data Files** (Static):
- Spells (spell definitions)
- Monsters (monster stats)
- Items (item properties)
- Maps (dungeon layouts)

## Class Changing

**Source**: Strategy Wiki - Trebor's Castle (validated 2025-10-26)

Characters can change class if they meet the new class requirements:

**What Happens When Changing Class**:
- Resets to level 1
- Experience resets to zero
- **Stats**: Attributes reset to racial minimums (not kept at current values!)
- **Spells**: Previously learned spells are remembered with minimum spell points restored
- **Equipment**: Retained but unequipped (must re-equip if new class allows)
- **Aging**: Character ages during retraining process
- **Spell Learning**: All spells in a learned spell level eventually become available

**Important Notes**:
- You must meet ALL stat requirements for the new class
- Stats resetting to racial minimums means you may LOSE attribute points
- However, spell knowledge is preserved, making class changes valuable for building versatile characters
- Can multi-class repeatedly to build ultimate character with multiple spell schools

**Common Paths**:
1. Mage → Samurai (after building STR/VIT/AGI through aging/items)
2. Priest → Lord (after building STR/VIT/AGI/LUC through aging/items)
3. Fighter → Samurai (after building INT/PIE through aging/items)
4. Any → Ninja (after maxing all stats through aging/items - extremely difficult)
5. Mage/Priest → Bishop → Lord/Samurai (to gain both spell types, then switch to hybrid warrior)

2. Fighter (front) - Tank

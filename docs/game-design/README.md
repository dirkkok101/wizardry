## Purpose

Game design docs are **player-focused**, describing what the game does (not how it's implemented).

**Use these docs to**:
- Understand game mechanics
- Design UI/UX
- Write player-facing help text
- Validate against original Wizardry 1

## Documentation Style

**What the Game Does** (not how it's coded)
- Focus on player experience
- Explain mechanics clearly
- Include strategy tips
- Use tables and examples

**Validated Against Original**:
All mechanics validated against Wizardry 1 sources in `/docs/research/`

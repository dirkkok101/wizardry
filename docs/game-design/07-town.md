# Town

**Safe haven and services in the castle above the dungeon.**

## Town Overview

The town is your safe hub between dungeon expeditions. Here you can heal, resurrect dead characters, buy equipment, train characters, and manage your party.

## Town Services

## Town Strategy

- Class changes (very expensive)
- Temple services

**Priority Spending**:
1. Resurrections (don't lose characters!)

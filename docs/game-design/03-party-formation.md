# Party Formation

**How to build and manage your adventuring party.**

## Party Basics

### Party Size
- **Minimum**: 1 character (solo play, very hard)
- **Maximum**: 6 characters
- **Recommended**: 4-6 characters for balanced gameplay

### Formation

**Front Row**: Maximum 3 characters
- Takes melee hits from enemies
- Can attack with melee weapons
- Needs high HP and good armor

**Back Row**: Maximum 3 characters
- Protected from most melee attacks
- Cannot use melee weapons (spells and ranged only)
- Ideal for spellcasters

## Formation Strategy

### Who Goes Where

**Front Row Priority**:
1. Fighters (high HP, best armor)
2. Lords (fighter-level HP + healing)
3. Samurai (fighter-level HP + magic)
4. Priests (if wearing heavy armor)

**Back Row Priority**:
1. Mages (no armor, low HP - will die in front)
2. Bishops (limited armor, spellcaster)
3. Thieves (leather armor only)
4. Priests (if low armor)

**Ninjas**: Can go either row (high AC unarmored, but benefit from back row safety)

### Front Row Protection

**How it Works**:
- Front row characters take most enemy melee attacks
- Back row only hit by:
  - Breath weapons
  - Area spells
  - Special attacks
  - When front row is dead/paralyzed

**Strategy**: Put your tankiest characters in front

## Party Composition

### Minimum Viable Party (4 Characters)

1. **Fighter** (front) - Tank and damage
2. **Priest** (front or back) - Healing
3. **Mage** (back) - Offensive magic
4. **Thief** (back) - Disarm traps

**Why**: Covers all essential roles

### Balanced Party (6 Characters)

1. **Fighter** (front) - Tank
2. **Fighter** (front) - Tank
3. **Priest** (front) - Healer + melee
4. **Thief** (back) - Traps
5. **Mage** (back) - Damage
6. **Mage** (back) - Damage

**Why**:
- 3 front = maximum protection
- 2 mages = massive damage output
- Priest in front with armor = survivable healer
- Essential thief for dungeon

### Advanced Party (Elite Classes)

1. **Lord** (front) - Tank + healing
2. **Samurai** (front) - Tank + magic
3. **Fighter** (front) - Pure tank
4. **Thief** (back) - Traps
5. **Bishop** (back) - All spells + identify
6. **Mage** (back) - Damage specialist

**Why**:
- Lords replace Priest (fighter + heals)
- Samurai replace Mage/Fighter hybrid
- Bishop covers both spell types
- More versatile for tough encounters

### Alternative Compositions

**Mage-Heavy (Glass Cannon)**:
1. Fighter (front)
2. Priest (front)
3. Mage (back)
4. Mage (back)
5. Mage (back)
6. Thief (back)

**Risk**: Fragile if front row falls
**Reward**: Massive spell damage

**Warrior-Heavy (Tank Squad)**:
1. Fighter (front)
2. Fighter (front)
3. Fighter (front)
4. Lord (back) - Healing
5. Samurai (back) - Utility magic
6. Thief (back) - Traps

**Risk**: Limited spell options
**Reward**: Very hard to kill, sustained damage

## Essential Roles

### 1. Tank (Required)
**Classes**: Fighter, Lord, Samurai
**Why**: Someone must absorb damage
**Minimum**: 1, Ideal: 2-3

### 2. Healer (Required)
**Classes**: Priest, Lord, Bishop
**Why**: Restore HP during/after combat
**Minimum**: 1, Ideal: 1-2

### 3. Damage Dealer (Required)
**Classes**: Mage, Samurai, Fighter, Bishop
**Why**: Kill enemies efficiently
**Minimum**: 2, Ideal: 3-4

### 4. Thief (Essential)
**Classes**: Thief
**Why**: Only class that can disarm traps
**Minimum**: 1, Ideal: 1

**Note**: You CAN play without a Thief, but chests will be very dangerous

## Party Management

### Changing Formation

**When**: At any time in camp (not during combat)

**How**:
1. Open party menu
2. Select character
3. Choose "Move to Front Row" or "Move to Back Row"

**Limits**:
- Front row max 3
- Back row max 3

### Adding Characters

**Where**: Town (Training Grounds)

**Process**:
1. Go to Training Grounds
2. Select "Add to Party"
3. Choose character from roster
4. Character joins party

**Limits**: Maximum 6 total characters

### Removing Characters

**Where**: Town (Training Grounds)

**Process**:
1. Go to Training Grounds
2. Select "Remove from Party"
3. Choose character to remove
4. Character returns to roster (safe in town)

**Warning**: Don't remove characters in dungeon - they're stuck!

## Party Size Strategy

### Solo Play (1 Character)
**Difficulty**: Extreme
**Viable Classes**: Lord (healing + fighting), Samurai (magic + fighting)
**Challenge**: No backup if stunned/killed

### Duo (2 Characters)
**Difficulty**: Very Hard
**Recommended**: Lord + Mage, or Samurai + Priest
**Challenge**: Limited tactical options

### Trio (3 Characters)
**Difficulty**: Hard
**Recommended**: Fighter + Priest + Mage
**Balance**: Covers basics but fragile

### Quad (4 Characters)
**Difficulty**: Normal
**Recommended**: Fighter + Priest + Mage + Thief
**Balance**: Solid for most encounters

### Penta (5 Characters)
**Difficulty**: Easier
**Extra**: Second tank or second mage
**Balance**: Strong flexibility

### Full Party (6 Characters)
**Difficulty**: Balanced as designed
**Setup**: 3 front / 3 back
**Balance**: Maximum tactical options

## Common Mistakes

1. **All Back Row**: No one to absorb hits = party wipe
2. **No Healer**: Will slowly die from accumulated damage
3. **No Thief**: Chests explode, kill party
4. **One Front-Line**: Falls quickly, exposes back row
5. **Imbalanced Levels**: Low-level character dies easily

## Formation Tactics

### Standard Formation
```
Front: Fighter - Lord - Samurai
Back:  Thief - Bishop - Mage
```
**Use**: General exploration, balanced encounters

### Defensive Formation
```
Front: Fighter - Fighter - Fighter
Back:  Priest - Priest - Thief
```
**Use**: Tough encounters, many melee enemies

### Offensive Formation
```
Front: Samurai - Lord - Fighter
Back:  Mage - Mage - Mage
```
**Use**: When you need burst damage, risky encounters

### Exploration Formation
```
Front: Fighter - Priest - Lord
Back:  Thief - Mage - Bishop
```
**Use**: Long dungeon trips, need sustainability + utility

## Party Synergy

### Good Combinations

**Lord + Samurai**: Hybrid classes cover fighter + both casters
**Bishop + Priest**: Bishop learns slowly, Priest provides immediate heals
**Fighter + Priest + Mage**: Classic trio, proven effective
**Double Mages**: Twice the firepower, wipe enemy groups fast

### Bad Combinations

**All Mages**: No tank = instant death
**No Priest/Lord/Bishop**: No healing = slow death
**Multiple Thieves**: Only need one, wasted party slots
**Priests + Bishops only**: Can't deal enough damage

## Progression Considerations

### Early Game (Levels 1-3)
**Priority**: Survival
**Formation**: Maximum front-line protection
**Classes**: Basic classes (Fighter, Priest, Mage, Thief)

### Mid Game (Levels 4-7)
**Priority**: Efficiency
**Formation**: Balanced 3/3 split
**Classes**: Can start using elite classes if created

### Late Game (Levels 8-10)
**Priority**: Power
**Formation**: Optimized for boss fights
**Classes**: Elite classes shine (Lords/Samurai/Ninjas)

# Death & Recovery

**What happens when characters die and how to recover them.**

## Death in Wizardry

**Wizardry is brutal.** Death is permanent unless you successfully resurrect fallen characters. This system makes every combat decision meaningful and every character valuable.

## When Characters Die

### During Combat

**HP Reaches 0**: Character dies immediately

**Effects**:
- Character becomes inactive (no more actions)
- Body remains with party
- Cannot cast spells or fight
- Still "present" (can be targeted by healing/resurrection)

**If Entire Party Dies**:
- **GAME OVER**
- All bodies left at death location in dungeon
- Must create new party to attempt recovery

### Death Causes

**Combat Damage**: Most common (HP reduced to 0)
**Instant Death Effects**:
- Decapitation (Ninjas, some monsters)
- Petrification (Medusalizard, Gorgon, MALIKTO spell)
- Poison (if HP reaches 0 from poison)
- Death spells (BADI, MABADI from enemies)

**Old Age**: Characters can die of natural causes if too old (rare)

**MALOR Accident**: Teleporting into solid rock (instant party wipe)

## States of Death

### Dead (Body)

**Condition**: Recently died, body intact
**Location**: With party (in combat) or at death site (party wipe)
**Resurrection**: DI spell (Priest level 7) or Temple service
**Success Rate**: ~90%
**Failure**: Body turns to ashes

**Time Limit**: None specifically, but bodies can be lost if party wipes again

### Ashes

**Condition**: Body turned to ashes (failed DI resurrection)
**Resurrection**: KADORTO spell (Priest level 5) or Temple service
**Success Rate**: ~50%
**Failure**: Character lost forever (permanent death)

**Cannot Delay**: Must attempt resurrection or risk permanent loss

### Lost Forever

**Condition**: Failed KADORTO resurrection
**Recovery**: **IMPOSSIBLE** - character is gone permanently
**Only Option**: Create new character to replace them

## Resurrection Methods

### In-Dungeon Resurrection

**DI Spell** (Priest Level 7):
- Cast on dead party member's body
- Success: ~90%, character returns to life with low HP
- Failure: Body turns to ashes
- Cost: 1 level-7 spell point
- Risk: If priest has no spell points, must return to town

**KADORTO Spell** (Priest Level 5):
- Cast on ashes
- Success: ~50%, character returns to life with very low HP
- Failure: Character lost forever
- Cost: 1 level-5 spell point
- Risk: High failure rate

**When to Use**:
- Emergency situations
- Deep in dungeon, can't retreat
- Have spell points to spare

**When NOT to Use**:
- Near town (safer at temple)
- Low spell points (might need for combat)
- Can retreat safely

### Temple Resurrection

**Service**: Temple of Resurrection in town

**For Dead Bodies**:
- Priest casts DI spell
- Success: ~90%
- Failure: Body → ashes
- Cost: Based on character level (e.g., Level × 150 gold)

**For Ashes**:
- Priest casts KADORTO spell
- Success: ~50%
- Failure: Character lost forever (permanent death)
- Cost: Much higher (e.g., Level × 500 gold)

**When to Use**: Always prefer temple over in-dungeon (same success rate, safer)

## Body Recovery System

### Party Member Dies

**Scenario**: One party member dies, others survive

**Process**:
1. Continue fighting or retreat
2. Dead character's body stays with party
3. Return to town
4. Resurrect at temple

**Strategy**: Retreat if multiple members die (risk total wipe)

### Entire Party Wipes

**Scenario**: All party members die

**Process**:
1. Game over screen
2. All bodies remain at death location in dungeon
3. Must create or form a new party
4. New party enters dungeon
5. Navigate to death location
6. Use KANDI spell (Priest level 4) to locate bodies
7. Retrieve bodies (automatic when reaching location)
8. Return to town
9. Resurrect at temple

**Risks**:
- Recovery party might die too
- Bodies might be in very dangerous area
- Multiple attempts may be needed

**KANDI Spell**: Shows direction to nearest dead character's body

### Multiple Body Recoveries

**Can Carry**: All dead bodies at once (no inventory limit for bodies)

**Strategy**:
1. Locate all bodies with KANDI
2. Collect all before returning
3. Resurrect all at temple

## Resurrection Success Factors

### VIT Affects Success

**Higher VIT**: Better resurrection chance (formula not fully known)
**Low VIT**: Worse chance, more likely to turn to ashes

**Strategy**: Prioritize VIT for important characters

### Character Level Affects Cost

**Higher Level**: More expensive resurrections
**Low Level**: Cheaper

**Gold Management**: Keep emergency resurrection fund

## Status Conditions That Prevent Resurrection

### Petrified (Turned to Stone)

**Caused By**:
- Medusalizard attack
- Gorgon breath
- MALIKTO spell

**Not Dead**: Character is stone statue, not corpse
**Temple Service**: Can cure petrification (expensive)
**Cannot Resurrect**: Must cure petrification first

### Decapitated

**Caused By**: Ninja critical hit (player or enemy)
**Instant Death**: No resurrection possible from decapitation
**Result**: Body turns directly to ashes
**Must Use**: KADORTO (50% success) or lose character

## Permanent Death

### When It Happens

**Failed KADORTO**: 50% chance when resurrecting from ashes
**Lost**: Character completely removed from game
**No Recovery**: Cannot get character back

### Consequences

**Lost Items**: All equipped items lost forever
**Lost Progress**: All levels, stats, spells gone
**Emotional Impact**: Can lose favorite characters

**Prevention**:
- Don't take unnecessary risks
- Retreat when in danger
- Keep resurrection funds available
- Have backup characters

## Death Prevention

### Combat Tactics

**Heal Proactively**: Don't wait until HP critical
**Retreat When Hurt**: Live to fight another day
**Buff Defense**: PORFIC, BAMATU, KATU spells
**Control Enemies**: KATINO (sleep), MORLIS (paralyze)

### Party Management

**Front Row Tanks**: High HP, good armor
**Back Row Protection**: Keep mages/bishops safe
**Emergency Healing**: Always have DIOS/DIAL ready
**Flee Option**: Don't be afraid to run

### Dungeon Strategy

**Know Your Limits**: Don't push too deep
**Save Often**: In town before dangerous areas
**Stock Spell Points**: Keep healing spells available
**Plan Retreats**: Know path back to stairs/exit

## Death Economics

### Resurrection Costs

**Dead → Alive** (DI):
- Temple cost: ~Level × 100-200 gold
- Success: 90%

**Ashes → Alive** (KADORTO):
- Temple cost: ~Level × 500-1000 gold
- Success: 50%

**Budget**: Keep 10,000+ gold for emergencies

### Lost Equipment

**Character Dies**: Equipment stays on body
**Resurrect**: Equipment returned with character
**Lost Forever**: Equipment lost if character lost forever

**Strategy**:
- Don't give best items to risky characters
- Insure expensive equipment with gold reserves

## Recovery Strategy

### Single Death

1. **Assess**: Can party continue?
2. **Retreat**: If multiple members low HP
3. **Continue**: If party still strong
4. **Return to Town**: ASAP when safe
5. **Resurrect**: At temple (90% success)

### Multiple Deaths

1. **Immediate Retreat**: Don't risk total wipe
2. **LOKTOFEIT**: Emergency teleport to town (if available)
3. **Fight to Stairs**: Navigate back carefully
4. **Resurrect All**: At temple

### Total Party Wipe

1. **Form Recovery Party**:
   - Different characters from roster, OR
   - Create new characters (Level 1)
2. **Level Up Recovery Party**: If using new characters
3. **Enter Dungeon**:
   - Navigate to death site
   - Use KANDI to locate bodies
4. **Retrieve Bodies**: Touch location to pick up
5. **Return to Town**: Carefully
6. **Resurrect**: At temple

**High-Level Wipe**: May require hiring high-level alternate party

## Famous Death Scenarios

### Level Drain Death

**Vampire Lord**: Drains 4 levels
**Result**: Character loses 4 levels, might drop below level 1 → instant death
**Prevention**: Avoid level-draining enemies when possible

### MALOR Accident

**Teleport Miscalculation**: Wrong coordinates
**Result**: Party teleports into solid rock → instant death for all
**Prevention**: Only use known-safe coordinates

### Poison Cascade

**Poisoned in Combat**: Taking damage each round
**Combat Ends**: Poison continues in dungeon
**No Healing**: HP reaches 0 from poison → death
**Prevention**: Cure poison immediately after combat
